Hello, and welcome to my blog. My name is Cosmin, and this space is where I share my journey connecting medicine with computer science.

My interest in technology started a long time ago. I graduated **Tudor Vianu National High School of Computer Science**, so I have a pretty solid background in informatics. Back then, I thought about following it up with a degree in Medical Engineering at the National University of Science and Technology Politehnica here in Bucharest, but I had a strong feeling that I couldn't really engineer for medicine without first understanding medicine itself. It felt more logical to build a solid medical foundation first, and so I challenged myself and chose to go to **Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy Bucharest**.

After graduating, I looked for a specialty that was close to research and technology. I chose Laboratory Medicine for my residency because it's a paraclinical field, focused on generating the objective data that patient care relies on. I knew this specialty would be the perfect environment to one day connect with my passion for informatics and technology.

Working in one of the largest **molecular pathology** labs at the **Bucharest University Emergency Hospital**, I was right where the data is generated, and when I saw how much information is hidden in sequencing results, my old passion for informatics came back stronger than ever.

Now, I feel ready for the next step - I am starting a Master's in Applied Bioinformatics for Life Sciences to finally bring my two interests together.

This blog is my practical notebook for that process. I write about the bioinformatic workflows and tools I get to try out and different other projects I get myself into, explaining them in very simple terms. Itâ€™s for me to organize my thoughts, and for anyone else who finds it useful.

Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoy following along.
