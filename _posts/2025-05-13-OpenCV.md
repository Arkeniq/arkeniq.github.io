For a bit of a side project, I thought I'd try my hand at automating the reading of antibiograms using Python and OpenCV. The goal was to detect the antibiotic disks on an agar plate and then measure the diameter of the inhibition zones around them. Seemed like a classic computer vision task, and I was keen on trying it and learning more about the subject. They have a bunch of tutorials and good resources on their [page](https://opencv.org/news/). Definitely worth giving it a look. As far as I understand OpenCV is one of the oldest and coolest open-source computer vision projects, and a lot of people use it for a plethora of use cases.

Anyway, it turns out circles aren't always as simple as they look, especially to a computer... ðŸ˜‘

## ðŸ‘½ The plan

My approach involved a couple of main stages:

* Detecting the Antibiotic Disks: I figured SimpleBlobDetector in OpenCV would be a good starting point for finding the dark, circular antibiotic disks.
* Finding Inhibition Zones: Once a disk was found, the plan was to define a Region of Interest (ROI) around it, run Canny edge detection, and then use the Hough Circle Transform to find the clear circular zone of inhibition. Should work, right? Yeah, nah.

I tried to find the antibiotic disks first using SimpleBlobDetector. Then, for each disk, the script defines a region of interest, applies Canny edge detection, and then uses HoughCircles to find the inhibition zone. There's also logic to filter Hough circles based on concentricity with the disk.

![Failed detection OpenCV](assets/images/openCVplate.png){: w="700" }_Failed detection_

Despite a lot of parameter tweaking (you can see all the BLOB_ and HC_ constants I was playing with), getting consistent and reliable detection of both the disks and, more importantly, the often faint edges of the inhibition zones, proved really tough. You can see how even in this pretty simple example the algorithm struggled to detect one of the disks as well as one of the larger inhibition zones, whilst falsely detecting a zone where there wasn't any.


## ðŸ¤– I'LL BE BACK

While traditional OpenCV is amazing, this kind of complex pattern recognition in variable biological images is often where Machine Learning and AI really shine these days.

My plan is to eventually come back to this antibiogram challenge, but next time I'll be looking into AI-driven solutions. Maybe a dedicated object detection model (like YOLOv2 - no, not *"you only live once"*, calm down there millennials) trained on disks and zones, or perhaps leveraging some of the newer multimodal LLMs that are getting good at image interpretation.

When I do (and hopefully have a different story to tell), I'll be sure to post an update. For now, this particular OpenCV quest is *paused*.
