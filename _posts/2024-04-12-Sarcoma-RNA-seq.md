## Experimental Overview ðŸ§ª

RNA-Seq analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between and 

## Wetlab Phase ðŸ’§

<dl>
<dt>1. RNA Extraction</dt>
<dd>Total RNA was extracted using QIAGEN's RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Kit from tumoral tissue preserved in RNAlater. After extraction, Invitrogen Qubit RNA High Sensitivity Kit was used to assess the RNA concentration. Yield: <b>X ng/ÂµL</b>, RIN: <b>X.X</b>.</dd>

<dt>2. Library Preparation</dt>
<dd>mRNA enrichment via poly(A) selection, fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, and adapter ligation using [kit name]. Libraries were QC'd with Bioanalyzer.</dd>

<dt>3. Sequencing</dt>
<dd>Paired-end (2 Ã— 150 bp) sequencing on an Illumina [platform], generating ~X million reads per sample.</dd>
</dl>

## Drylab Time ðŸ§¬

### 1. Quality Control & Trimming ðŸš€

QC and adapter trimming were done using FastQC and Trimmomatic.

```bash
fastqc *.fastq.gz
trimmomatic PE -threads 8 input_R1.fastq.gz input_R2.fastq.gz \
  output_R1_paired.fastq.gz output_R1_unpaired.fastq.gz \
  output_R2_paired.fastq.gz output_R2_unpaired.fastq.gz \
  ILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fa:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:50
```

### 2. Alignment ðŸ“Œ

Reads were aligned to the reference genome ([Genome version]) using HISAT2.

```bash
hisat2 -p 8 -x genome_index -1 output_R1_paired.fastq.gz -2 output_R2_paired.fastq.gz \
  -S aligned_reads.sam
```

SAM files were converted to sorted BAM files using SAMtools:

```bash
samtools view -bS aligned_reads.sam | samtools sort -o aligned_reads_sorted.bam
samtools index aligned_reads_sorted.bam
```

### 3. Gene Quantification ðŸ“Š

FeatureCounts was used to assign reads to genes:

```bash
featureCounts -T 8 -a annotation.gtf -o counts.txt aligned_reads_sorted.bam
```

### 4. Differential Expression Analysis ðŸ”¬

DESeq2 was used for identifying DEGs.

```r
library(DESeq2)
counts <- read.table("counts.txt", header=TRUE, row.names=1)
coldata <- data.frame(condition=c("A", "A", "B", "B"))
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, colData=coldata, design=~condition)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds)
write.csv(res, file="DEGs.csv")
```

### 5. Functional Enrichment Analysis ðŸ”Ž

Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment were performed using g:Profiler.

```r
library(clusterProfiler)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
enriched <- enrichGO(gene=rownames(res[res$padj < 0.05, ]), OrgDb=org.Hs.eg.db, ont="BP", pAdjustMethod="BH")
```

## Results & Insights ðŸ“Œ

- **X** genes were differentially expressed (<i>padj</i> < 0.05).
- Upregulated pathways: [Pathway X, Pathway Y]
- Downregulated pathways: [Pathway Z]
- [Biological interpretation and next steps]
